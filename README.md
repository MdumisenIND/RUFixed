Information Systems 3 System Development Project
In our third year of Information Systems, we were tasked with developing a web based system to be used by an I.T repair department, replacing
the current paper based model.
The system was developed throughout the year, using a waterfa;; approach to software development.
This is the final system developed in the implementation stage.
I was head developer for the project and our team managed to come second from all the effort we put in throughout the year (including this 
implementation and the documents handed in for previous stages).
